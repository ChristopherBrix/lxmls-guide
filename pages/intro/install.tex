\subsection{Desktops vs. Laptops}

If you have decided to use one of our provided desktops, all installation
procedures have been carried out. You merely need to go to the
\verb+lxmls-toolkit-student+ folder inside your home directory and start
working! You may go directly to section \ref{sec:SolvingExercises}.  If you
wish to use your own laptop, you will need to install Python, all
required Python libraries, and the LXMLS code base. Please follow the
instructions appropriate for your operating system.

\subsection{Installing in Windows and Mac}

While Python is easy to install, some of the Python modules are based in C and
thus require a compiler to be installed from scratch. The following packages
are needed for the summer school toolkit 

\begin{verbatim}
pyyaml
nltk
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
mrjob
theano 
\end{verbatim}

Fortunately, there are some companies which distribute Windows and Mac versions
of Python including all C-based libraries which we need, for free. We recommend
that you install Anaconda, a Python distribution which is free to use. You can
get it from 

\begin{verbatim}http://continuum.io/downloads\end{verbatim}

\noindent Just go to the corresponding websites and follow the instructions for
installation. Make sure you install a 2.7.x version, not a 3.x version!.

Anaconda is the safest way if you are starting from scratch and you do not
feel comfortable with your operating system. If you are already familiar with
Python and your OS you can install the packages via trustworthy executables 
in Windows or brew/port package managers in OSX. Another option is to use 
a Python package manager. For this we recommend pip.

% MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS
%
%Any python 2.7.x version will do. You can check the version by  
%
%If you do not have python, you can install the latest 2.7+ python from the official website at
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Do not install python 3.x.x versions, this is a backwards incompatible version that can not use most of the tools of the labs. 
%
%Then we will need to instal some specific Python modules and the ipython shell. The easiest way to do this is by installing a python module manager.
%
%
%
%
%Now we need the ipython interactive shell. Again we use the command line (be sure to exit python first by using exit() or ctrl+d).
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%>ipython
%\end{verbatim}
%
%if this is recognized then great
% 
%
%If you do not know if you have a module manager installed open a command window
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%press the windows-key + R 
%write cmd and press enter  
%try the command pip 
%try the command easy_install 
%\end{verbatim}
%

%After hovering the mouse over downloads, you will see various options for installation. You can instal the version 2.7.x, any number for x is ok. Please do not instal version 3 or superior. If you already have a python 2.7 (any version) installed, you dont need to install another one, it will work. If you have older versions of python it might still work. In any case please uninstall any previous python version before installing a new one. This is a frequent source of problems on all systems.
%
%Now for the different python modules needed. The most straightforward way to instal the modules is through a python package manager, we recommend pip 
%
%[lot to do here ...]
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%pip install -r pip-requirements.txt 
%\end{verbatim}
%

\subsection{Installing in Linux}

Installation of Python and its related packages in Linux is best done from your
distribution's package manager. See, for example, the instruction for some of the
scientific tools needed 

\begin{verbatim}
http://www.scipy.org/install.html
\end{verbatim}

Please remember to install a Python 2.7.x version, not a 3.x version!. If you
do not manage to install the packages via your OS packet manager you can 
resort to a python package manager like pip.  

\subsection{Testing your installation}

To check whether your Python installation is working, start by invoking the
Python shell. You can do that by running the command \verb+python+ in your
Terminal in Linux or Mac, or the file \verb+python.exe+ from the folder where
Python was installed in, for Windows.

In the Python interpreter, the very first line should read like
\begin{verbatim}
Python 2.7.3 (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:58:35)
\end{verbatim}
%
In this case, the Python version was 2.7.3. Please make sure that in your case
this reads \verb+2.7.x+, where \verb+x+ is some number. Newer versions such as
3.4 have not been tested with our code.

To test whether Numpy is working, type the following two lines in the Python interpreter:
%
\begin{verbatim}
import numpy
numpy.test()
\end{verbatim}
%
The last two lines should read something like
%
\begin{verbatim}
OK (KNOWNFAIL=3, SKIP=4)
<nose.result.TextTestResult run=3161 errors=0 failures=0>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Jupyter Notebook}

Jupyter is also a good choice when writing Python code. It is an interactive computational environment for data science and scientific computing, where you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents, which contains live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. It is very popular in the areas of data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and so on. It supports more than 40 programming languages, including all those popular ones used in Data Science such as Python, R, and Scala.

It can produce many different types of output such as images, videos, LaTex and JavaScript. More over with its interactive widgets, you can manipulate and visualize data in realtime.

We summary the main features and advantages using  Jupyter Notebook as followings:

\begin{itemize}

\item In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion/introspection.

\item The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.

\item Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality figures rendered by the matplotlib library, can be included inline.

\item In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.

\item The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.

\end{itemize}

It is also integrated with Anaconda, so we recommend Anaconda for installing Jupyter. After installing, you can launch it in Anaconda by clicking the icon of Jupyter.

But if you are already a Python user, you may want to use pip as an alterntive:

\begin{verbatim}
pip install jupyter
\end{verbatim}

And launch it:

\begin{verbatim}
jupyter notebook
\end{verbatim}

A more detailed user guide can be found here:

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Downloading the labs version from GitHub}

The code of LxMLS is available online at GitHub. There are two branches of the
code: the \verb+master+ branch contains fully functional code. The
\verb+student+ branch contains the same code with some parts deleted, which you
must complete in the following exercises. To download the \verb+student+ code,
go to

\begin{verbatim}
https://github.com/gracaninja/lxmls-toolkit
\end{verbatim}

\noindent and select the \verb+student+ branch in the dropdown menu. This will
reload the page to the corresponding branch. Now you just need to click the
\verb+download ZIP+ button to obtain the lab tools in a zip format:

\begin{verbatim}
lxmls-toolkit-student.zip
\end{verbatim}

After this you can unzip the file where you want to work and enter this folder.
To check that all the modules we will use work, please run the
\verb+all_imports.py+ file found in the \verb+lxmls-toolkit-student+ folder.
