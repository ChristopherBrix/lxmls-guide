In this lab, we will work with Amazon.com's Web Services, a cloud based solution
to run some simple analyses. Then, in the next lab, we will build on these
tools to construct a larger learning system.

\section{Introduction}

AWS is a set of services of different types. We will focus on the \emph{Elastic
Compute Cluster}, EC2.


In this lab, we will be logging in to Linux-based machines using a command line
interface. If you are not familiar with the command line, you may not grasp all
the nuances

\section{Running Your First Hadoop Job}

You should have received a piece of paper with the following two pieces of
information:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A host name
\item A password
\end{enumerate}

This is the login to your private online server! Your hostname will look
something like \texttt{ec2-54-234-117-69.compute-1.amazonaws.com} and you
should be able to log in with username \texttt{ubuntu} and the password you
were given. If you are using the command line, you can just type:

ssh ubuntu@ec2-54-234-117-69.compute-1.amazonaws.com

(accept the RSA key and log in with the password we provided you).

The machine has all of the necessary Python packages for you to work. It also
has a standard collection of editors and other tools. It is an Ubuntu based
installation and you can access super user powers with \texttt{sudo} (Don't
worry if you did not understand this last sentence).

\subsection{Running Word Count using Hadoop}

\section{MapReduce \& Hadoop}

The initial idea of MapReduce was an implementation by google, but very soon
Hadoop appeared as an open-source implementation of the same paradigm.

\subsection{Word Count}

\begin{python}
def count(doc):
    from collections import defaultdict
    c = defaultdict(int)
    for w in doc.split():
        c[w] += 1
    for w,c in c.items():
        yield w,c

def combine(key, cs):
    yield key, sum(cs)

\end{python}


\subsection{Naïve Bayes}

The implementation of binary Naïve Bayes is very similar to counting words: we just
need to keep track of the class of each document and maintain.
